# Putting Tufte’s claims to the test

Consider the following two visualizations which depict evidence of
climate change:

## A Timeline of Earth’s Average Temperature. Source: [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1732/)

1.  Evaluate both graphs under Tufte’s objective of maximizing the
    data-ink ratio. From Tufte’s objective of maximizing the data-ink
    ratio, I think the first graph is a rather good visualization
    (although it still contains some elements that can be deleted under
    Tufte’s very strict standards, for example the frame around the text
    at bottom right, and the text “year” at the bottom – everyone can
    recognize the numbers on the x-axis are years). Each of the element
    contains some quantitative information: if we delete them we may
    lose some signals from the data. For example: different colors
    represent different sources of temperature info; x-axis shows the
    year; y-axis shows the departure from 1961-1990 average. This
    picture does so well that not a single piece of text is redundant.
    Tufte would love this picture. However, the second picture goes
    against Tufte’s principles in nearly every aspect. Many inks in this
    figure does not contain any quantitative information, but is used
    just for aesthetic reasons. For example, it has different colors for
    each column to show the differences in temperature: however, this is
    redundant because the number on the x-axis has shown the different
    temperatures. The texts and small pictures in the figure tells many
    interesting stories about people’s living experiences in each era:
    however, they are not quantitative, statistical information—the
    quantitative part of the story can be presented by a number on the
    y-axis. The font of the text is also cute but not functional—Tufte
    would love standard font instead of this beautiful one. To sum up,
    from Tufte’s principle to maximize the data-ink ratio, I think the
    first figure is much better than the second one—it is more simple,
    clear, scientific, and less redundant.

2.  Evaluate both graphs under Alberto Cairo’s five characteristics of
    data visualizations. 2.1 Is it truthful? For this question, I assume
    that the data sources for both pictures are reliable. If so, I guess
    both figures are truthful—although the first one is easier to read
    and present the information in a more organized way. 2.2 Is it
    functional? Yes—I think both figures are functional. Both figures
    convey the information to the readers, and can provide support to
    the main arguments. However, they may serve different purpose and
    are functional in different senses. The first figure is a scientific
    figure, which may serve well in a scientific report and a
    publishable manuscript. However, if it appears in a magazine, it
    would drive away many readers because it is a little boring. The
    second figure contains many interesting stories and beautiful
    interface, which makes it perfect for magazine or other public
    media. It will make the readers excited. However, it is extremely
    inappropriate in more serious publications, like science journals,
    government reports, etc. It is not simple and clear enough to convey
    the most important info in a short time. 2.3 Is it beautiful?
    Yeah—from my personal perspective both are beautiful, and I like
    the first one a little more because I love these well-arranged
    academic stuffs. However, some other people will think the second
    one is more beautiful—it is more colorful, contains more vivid
    information, and has a more reader-friendly atmosphere. 2.4 Is it
    insightful? Both are insightful. The first figure helps us to think
    about the different between different data sources of historical
    temperature, and the general trend of historical temperature change.
    The second figure allows us to get a better understanding of human
    experiences in different eras with different temperatures. Both
    figures convey some useful and interesting information that allows
    us to explore relevant topics. 2.5 Is it enlightening? Yes—I guess
    both are enlightening, but in different ways. The first allows us to
    think about different features of different data source: why tree
    rings/corals/ice cores have much more fluctuations than historical
    records? Is it because of the technological limitations of human
    beings, or other reasons? The second figure allows us to think more
    about human experiences in each time period. What is the
    relationship between temperature and the life quality of humans?
    Will temperature have any influence on our future benefits?

3.  Which graph do you prefer? Under what circumstances would you select
    one graph over the other? That depends on the scenarios. If I am
    writing a scientific paper or government report about temperature
    change, I would certainly use the first one—the second one would
    lead to desk rejection because it is not simple and clear enough.
    However, the second one would be much better than the first one for
    a website, magazine, or brochure. It is more attractive and
    colorful, which makes it easier to attract more readers.
